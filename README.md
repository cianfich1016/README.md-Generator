  ## Description
  This project allows a user to create a unique README.md file using his or her very own terminal from the generation of questions and input responses. The automatic creation saves a user time while producing a markdown file with a high quality layout and valuable information each and every time. The understanding of the power of the terminal and Node.js allowed for the creation of this generator.
